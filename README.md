# Finddit

A Reddit article search application built with vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap

Demo url - [https://viralharia.github.io/finddit/](https://viralharia.github.io/finddit/)


The application is making an api request to below url and displaying the results in the card format.

https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=${searchTerm}&sort=${sortBy}&limit=${searchLimit}

It demonstrates my understanding of Javascript and Bootstrap framework.
